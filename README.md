This MATLAB (2023a) script contains code to construct elastograms (2D maps of shear wave velocity) of homogeneous and heterogeneous tissues from ARFI Shear Wave Elastography (SWE). The code is applied to the ARFI SWE data from the IEEE UFFC-JS 2024 Challenge 'Algorithms for Mapping Elastic Modulus (a-MEM)'.

The methods used in this script are described in the corresponding proceeding: Cihan A., Segers P. and Caenen A., "A Robust Pipeline Including Directional Filtering and Wave Propagation Zones for Mapping Shear Wave Velocity", IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Joint Symposium (UFFC-JS), 2024. Please refer to this proceeding when using the code.
